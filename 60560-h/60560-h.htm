<p class="ph1">THE SOUTH AFRICAN<br />
QUESTION.</p></div>


<p class="ind">Many views have found expression
in the columns of papers during the last
weeks. The working man only a few
weeks or months from England has expressed
his opposition to those stratagems
with war for their aim which
would leave him without the defence
he has at present from the pressure of
employers. Journalists only a few years,
months, or weeks from Europe, have
written, not perhaps expressing a desire
for war, but implying it might be
well if the wave swept across South
Africa, and especially across that portion
which is richest in mineral wealth,
and, therefore, more to be desired.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
South Africans and men from Europe
alike have written deprecating war, because
of the vast suffering and loss it
would occasion to individuals. Dutch
and English South Africans have written
(as one in an able and powerful letter
dated from Vrededorp, which appeared
a few days ago) proving the
injustice that would be inflicted on the
people of Africa, the violation of
treaties and trust. But, amid all this
chorus of opinion there is one voice
which, though heard, has not yet been
heard with that distinctness and fulness
which its authority demands&mdash;it is the
voice of the African-born Englishman
who loves England, the man who, born
in South Africa, and loving it as all
men, who are men, love their birth-land,
is yet an Englishman, bound to
England not only by ties of blood, but<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that much more intense passion which
springs from personal contact alone.
Our position is unique, and it would
seem that we are marked out, at the
present juncture of South African affairs,
for an especial function, which
imposes on us, at whatever cost to ourselves,
the duty of making our voices
heard and taking our share in the life
of our two nations, at their</p>



<p class="center">MOST CRITICAL JUNCTURE.</p>

<p class="ind">For, let us consider what exactly
our position is.</p>

<p class="ind">Born in South Africa, our eyes first
opened on these African hills and
plains; around us, of other parentage
but born with us in the land, our birth-fellows,
were men of another white
race; and we grew up side by side with
them. Is it strange that, like all men<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
living, who have the hearts of men, we
learnt to love this land in which we
first saw light? In after years, when
we left it, and lived months or years
across the seas, is it strange we carried
it with us in our hearts? When we
stood on the Alps and looked down on
the lakes and forests of Switzerland,
that we have said, &#8220;This is fair, but
South Africa to us is fairer?&#8221; That
when on the top of Milan Cathedral
and we have looked out across the wide
plains of Lombardy, we have said,
&#8220;This is noble; but nobler to us are the
broad plains of Africa, with their
brown kopjes shimmering in the translucent
sunshine?&#8221; Is it strange that
when, after long years of absence, years
it may be of success and the joy which
springs from human fellowship and
youth, our ship has cast its anchor in<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sight of Table Bay, and the great front
of Table Mountain has reared up before
us, a cry of passionate joy has
welled up within us; and when we saw
the black men with their shining skins
unloading in the docks, and the rugged
faces of South Africans, browned with
our African sun, we put our foot on
the dear old earth again, and our hearts
have cried: &#8220;We are South Africans!
We have come back again to our land
and to our people?&#8221; Is it strange that
when we are in other lands and we fear
that death approaches us, we say:
&#8220;Take me back! We may live away
from her, but when we are dead we
must lie on her breast. Bury us among
the kopjes where we played when we
were children, and let the iron stones
and red sand cover us?&#8221; Is it strange
that wherever we live we all want to<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
go home to die; and that the time comes
when we know that dearer far to us
than fame or success is one little handful
of our own red South African
earth? Is it strange that, when the</p>

<p class="center">TIME OF STRESS AND DANGER</p>

<p>comes to our land, we realize what, perhaps,
we were but dimly conscious of
before, that we are Africans, that for
this land and people we could live&mdash;if
need be, we could die?</p>

<p class="ind">Is it strange we should feel this?
The Scotchman feels it for his heathery
hills, the Swiss for his valleys. All
men who are men feel it for the land
of their birth!</p>

<p class="ind">What is strange is not that we have
this feeling, but that, side by side with
it, we have another. We love Africa,
but we love England also. It is not<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
merely that when for the first time we
visit the old nesting place of our people
it is rich for us with associations,
that we tread it for the first time with
something of the awe and reverence
with which men tread an old cathedral,
rich with remains of the great
dead and past; it is not merely that
the associations of language and literature
bind us to it, nor that in some
city or country churchyard we stand
beside the graves of our forefathers,
and trace on mould-eaten stones the
names we have been familiar with in
Africa, and bear as our own; nor is it
that we can linger yet on the steps of
the church where our parents were
united before they moved to the far
South, and made of us South Africans.
Beyond all these impersonal,
and more or less intellectual ties, we<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
form a personal one with England.
Whether we have gone home as students
to college or university, or for
purposes of art, literature, or professional
labor, as time passes there
springs up around us</p>

<p class="center">A NETWORK OF TENDER BONDS;</p>

<p>there are formed the closest friendships
our hearts will ever know, such as are
formed only in the spring time of life;
there is gained our first deep knowledge
of life, and there grow up within us
passions and modes of thought we will
carry with us to our graves. After
years, it may be after many years, when
we return, on the walls of our study in
South Africa we still keep fastened in
memory of the past the old oar with
which we won our first boating victory
on Cam or Thames; and the faces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the men who shared our victory with
us still look down at us from our walls.
Not dearer to any Englishman is the
memory of his Alma Mater than to him
who sits thousands of miles off in the
South, and who, as he smokes his last
pipe of African Boer or Transvaal tobacco,
is visited often by memories of
days that will never fade, evenings on
the river with bright faces and soft
voices, long midnight conclaves over
glimmering fires, when, with voices and
hearts as young and glowing as our
own, we discussed all problems of the
universe and longed to go out into life
that we might settle them&mdash;they come
back to us with all the glitter and light
which hangs only about the remembrances
of youth: and for many of us
the memory of fog-smitten London is
inextricably blended with the all profoundest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
emotions, the most passionate
endeavors, noblest relations our hearts
will ever know. The steamers that
come weekly to South Africa are not
for us merely vessels bringing news
from foreign lands; nor do they merely
bring for us the intellectual pabulum
which feeds our mental life; they bring
us</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;NEWS FROM HOME.&#8221;</p>

<p>In London houses, in country cottages,
in English manufacturing towns, are
men and women whose life and labor,
whose joy and sorrows our hearts will
follow to the end, as theirs will follow
ours to the end, and across the seas our
hands will always be interknit with
theirs. Our labor, our homes, our material
interests, may all be in South
Africa, but a bond of love so strong
that six thousand miles of sea can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stretch it, but never sever it, binds us
to the land and the friends we loved in
our youth. We are South Africans,
but intellectual sympathies, habits, personal
emotions, have made us strike
deep roots across the sea; and when
the thought flashes on us, we may not
walk the old streets again or press the
old hands, pain rises which those only
know whose hearts are divided between
two lands. We are South Africans,
but we are not South Africans only&mdash;we
are Englishmen also:</p>

<div class="verse">Our heart in the sea!</div>
</div></div>

<p>If to-morrow hostile fleets encompassed
England, and the tread of foreign
troops was on her soil, she would not
need to call to us; we would stand beside
her before she had spoken. This is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>



<p class="center">OUR EXACT POSITION.</p>

<p class="ind">Side by side with us in South Africa
are other South Africans whose position
is not and cannot be exactly what
ours is. Shading away from us by imperceptible
degrees, stand, on one side
of us, those English South Africans
who, racially English, yet know nothing
or little personally of her; the
grandparents, and not the parents of
such men, have left England; they are
proud of being Englishmen, proud of
England&#8217;s great record and great
names, as a man is proud of his grandmother&#8217;s
family, but they are before all
things essentially South African. They
desire to see England increase and progress,
and to remain in harmony and
union with her while she does not interfere
with internal affairs of South
Africa, but they do not and cannot feel<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to her as those of us do whose love is
personal and whose intellectual sympathies
center largely in England.</p>

<p class="ind">Yet further from us on the same side
stand our oldest white fellow South
Africans; who were, many, not of English
blood originally, though among
that body of early white settlers, men
who preceded us in South Africa by
three centuries, were a few with English
names, and though by intermarriage
Dutch and English South Africans
are daily and hourly blending, the
bulk of these folk were Dutchmen from
Holland and Friesland, with a few
Swedes, Germans and Danes, and later
was intermingled with them a strong
strain of Huguenot blood from France.
These men were mainly of that folk
which, in the sixteenth century, held
Philip and the Spanish Empire at bay,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and struck the first death-blow into the
heart of that mighty Imperial system
whose death-gasp we have witnessed
to-day. A brave, free, fearless folk
with the</p>

<p class="center">BLOOD OF THE OLD SEA KINGS</p>

<p>in their veins; a branch of that old
Teutonic race which came with the
Angles and Saxons into England and
subdued the Britons, and who, in the
persons of the Franks, entered Gaul,
and spread its blood across Europe.
They are a people most nearly akin to
the English of all European folk, in
language, form and feature resembling
them, and in a certain dogged persistence,
and an inalienable indestructible
air of personal freedom.</p>

<p class="ind">Even under the early Dutch Government
of the East India Company, they<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were not always restful and resented
interference and external control. They
frequently felt themselves &#8220;ondergedrukt,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
and, taking their guns, and
getting together wife and children and
all that they had, and inspanning their
wagons, they trekked<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> away from the
scant boards of civilization into the
wilderness, to form homes of freedom
for themselves and their descendants.</p>

<p class="ind">In 1795 England obtained the Cape
as the result of European complications,
and the South African people,
without request or desire on their part,
were given over to England. England
retired from the Cape in 1803, but, owing
to other changes in Europe, she
took the Cape again in 1806, and has
since then been the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">GUARDIAN OF OUR SEAS,</p>

<p>and the strongest power in our land.
Since that time, for the last ninety
years, Englishmen have slowly been
added to the population, but the men
of Dutch descent still form the majority
of white South Africans throughout
the Cape Colony, Free State, and
Transvaal, outnumbering at the present
day, even with the accession of the
foreigners (Uitlanders mean foreigners
in Dutch) to the goldfields of the
Transvaal, those of English descent,
as probably about two to one.</p>

<p class="ind">So we of England became step-mother
to this South African people.
We English are a virile race. There is
perhaps no one with a drop of English
blood in his veins who does not feel
pride in that knowledge. We are a
brave and, for ourselves, a freedom-loving<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
race; the best of us have nobler
qualities yet&mdash;we love justice; we admire
courage and the love of freedom
in others as well as ourselves; and we
find it difficult to put our foot on the
weak, it refuses to go down. At times,
whether as individuals or as a nation,
we are capable of the</p>

<p class="center">MOST HEROIC MORAL ACTION.</p>

<p>The heart swells with pride when we
remember what has been done by Englishmen,
at different times and in different
places, in the cause of freedom and
justice, when they could meet with no
reward and had nothing to gain. Such
an act of justice on the part of the English
nation was done in 1881 when
Gladstone gave back to the Transvaal
the independence which had been mistakenly
taken. I would not say policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had no part in the action of the wise
old man. No doubt that keen eagle-eye
had fixed itself closely on the truth
which all history teaches that a colony
of Teutonic folk cannot be kept permanently
in harmony and union with
the Mother Country by any bond but
that of love, mutual sympathy and
honor. The child may be reduced by
force to obedience; but time passes and
the child becomes a youth; the youth
may be coerced; but the day comes
when the youth becomes a man, and
there can be no coercion then. If the
mother wishes to retain the affection of
the man, she must win it from the
youth. This the wise old man saw; but
I believe that, over and above the wisdom,
he saw the right, and the action
was no less heroic because it was wise;
for other men see truth who have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the courage to follow her, and accept
present loss for a gain which lies
across the centuries.</p>

<p class="ind">We English are a fearless folk, and
in the main I think we seek after justice,
but we have our faults. We are
not a sympathetic or a quickly comprehending
people; we are slow and we
are proud; we are shut in by a certain</p>

<p class="center">SHELL OF HARD RESERVE.</p>

<p>There are probably few of us who have
not some consciousness of this defect in
our own persons; it may be a fault allied
to our highest virtues, but it is a
fault, and a serious one as regards our
relations with peoples who come under
our rule. We may and do generally
sincerely desire justice; we may have
no wish to oppress, but we do not readily
understand wants and conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
distinct from our own. Here and there
great Englishmen have appeared in
South African history as elsewhere
(such as Sir William Porter and Sir
George Grey) who have been able to
throw themselves sympathetically into
the entire life of the people about, to
love them, and so to comprehend their
wants and win their affections. Such
men are the burning and shining lights
of our Imperial and Colonial system,
but they are not common. Undoubtedly
the officials sent out to rule the Cape
in the old days were generally men who
earnestly desired to do their duty; but
they did not always understand the folk
they had to rule. They were generally
simple soldiers, brave, fearless and honorable
as the English soldier is apt to
be, but with hard military conceptions
of government and discipline. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Dutch fellow South Africans are a
strange folk. Virile, resolute, passionate
with a passion hid far below the
surface, they are at once the gentlest
and the most determined of peoples.
When you try to coerce them they are
hard as steel encased in iron, but with a
large and generous response to affection
and sympathy which perhaps no
other European folk gives. They may
easily be deceived once; but never twice.
Under the roughest exterior of the up-country
Boer lies a nature strangely
sensitive and conscious of personal
dignity; a people who never forgets a
kindness and does</p>

<p class="center">NOT EASILY FORGET A WRONG.</p>

<p class="ind">Our officials did not always understand
them; they made no allowances
for a race of brave, free men inhabiting<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a country which by the might of their
own right hand they had won from savages
and wild beasts, and who were
given over into the hands of a strange
government without their consent or
desire; and the peculiarities which arose
from their wild free life were not always
sympathetically understood; even
their little language, the South African
&#8220;Taal,&#8221; a South African growth so
dear to their hearts, and to all those of
us who love indigenous and South
African growths, was not sympathetically
and gently dealt with. The
men, well meaning, but military, tried
with this fierce, gentle, sensitive, free
folk force, where they should have exercised
a broad and comprehensive
humanity; and when they did right (as
when the slaves were freed), they did
it often in such manner, that it became<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
practically wrong. A little of that tact
of the higher and larger kind, which
springs from a human comprehension
of another&#8217;s difficulties and needs,
might, exercised in the old days, have
saved South Africa from all white-race
problems; it was not, perhaps under
the conditions, could not, be exercised.
The people&#8217;s hearts ached under
the uncompromising iron rule. In 1815
there was a rising, and it was put down.
As the traveler passes by train along
the railway from Port Elizabeth to
Kimberley, he will come, a few miles
beyond Cookhouse, to a gap between
two hills; to his right flows the Fish
River; to his left, binding the two hills,
is a ridge of land called in South Africa
a &#8220;nek.&#8221; It is a spot the thoughtful
Englishman passes with deep pain. In
the year 1815 here were hanged five<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
South Africans who had taken part in
the rising, and the women who had
fought beside them (for the South
African woman has ever stood beside
the man in all his labors and struggles)
were compelled to stand by and look on.
The crowd of fellow South Africans
who stood by them believed,</p>

<p class="center">HOPED AGAINST HOPE,</p>

<p>to the last moment, that a reprieve
would come. Lord Charles Somerset
sent none, and the tragedy was completed.
The place is called to-day
&#8220;Schlachter&#8217;s Nek,&#8221; or &#8220;Butcher&#8217;s
Ridge.&#8221; Every South African child
knows the story. Technically, any government
has the right to hang those
who rise against its rule. Superficially
it is a short way of ending a difficulty
for all governments. Historically it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
has often been found to be the method
for perpetrating them. We may submerge
for a moment that which rises
again more formidably for its blood
bath. The mistake made by Lord
Charles Somerset in 1815 was as the
mistake would have been by President
Kruger if, in 1896, instead of exercising
the large prerogative of mercy and
magnanimity, he had destroyed the
handful of conspirators who attempted
to destroy the State. Both would have
been within their legal right, but the
Transvaal would have failed to find
that path which runs higher than the
path of mere law and leads towards
light. Fortunately for South Africa
our little Republic found it.</p>

<p class="ind">The reign of stern military rule at
the Cape had this effect, that men and
women, with a sore in their proud<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hearts, continued to move away from
a controlling power that did not understand
them. Some moved across the
Orange River and joined the old
&#8220;Voortrekkers&#8221; that had already gone
into that country which is now the Free
State. England kept a certain virtual
sovereignty over that territory, till, in
1854, she grew weary of the expense
it cost her, and withdrew from it in
spite of the representations of certain
of its inhabitants who sent a deputation
to England to request her to retain it.
Thereupon the folk organized an independent
State and Government; and the
little land, peopled mainly by men of
Dutch descent, but largely intermingled
with English who lived with them on
terms of the greatest affection and
unity, has become one of the most</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">PROSPEROUS, WELL-GOVERNED AND
PEACEFUL</p>

<p>communities on earth. Others, much
the larger part of the people, moved
further; they crossed the Vaal River,
and in that wild northern land, where
no Englishman&#8217;s foot had passed, they
founded after some years the gallant
little Republic we all know to-day as
the Transvaal. How that Republic
was founded is a story we all know.
Alone, unbacked by any great Imperial
or national power, with their old
flint-lock guns in their hands as their
only weapons, with wife and children,
they passed into that yet untrodden
land. The terrible story of their struggles,
the death of Piet Retief and his
brave followers, killed by treachery by
the Zulu Chief, Dingaan, the victory of
the survivors over him, which is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
commemorated by their children as
Dingaan&#8217;s Day, the whole, perhaps, the
most thrilling record of the struggle
and suffering of a people in founding
their State that the world can anywhere
produce. Paul Kruger can still
remember how, after that terrible fight,
women and children left alone in the
fortified laager, he himself being but a
child, they carried on bushes to fortify
the laager, women with children in
their arms, or pregnant, laboring with
strength of men to entrench themselves
against evil worse than death. Here in
the wilderness they planted their homes,
and founded their little State. Men
and women are still living who can remember
how, sixty years ago, the spot
where the great mining camp of Johannesburg
now stands was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
silence where they drew up their wagon
and planted their little home, and</p>

<p class="center">FOUGHT INCH BY INCH</p>

<p>with wild beasts to reclaim the desert.
In this great northern land, which no
white man had entered or desired, they
planted their people, and loving it as
men only can love the land they have
suffered and bled for, the gallant little
Republic they raised they love to-day as
the Swiss loves his mountain home and
the Hollander his dykes. It is theirs,
the best land on earth to them.</p>

<p class="ind">They had fought not for money but
for homes for their wives and children;
when they battled, the wives reloaded
the old flint-lock guns and handed them
down from the front chest of their
wagon for the men who stood around
defending them. It was a wild free<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fight, on even terms; there were no
Maxim guns to mow down ebony figures
by the hundred at the turn of a
handle; a free even stand up fight; and
there were times when it almost seemed
the assagai would overcome the old
flint-lock, and the voortrekkers would
be swept away. The panther and the
jaguar rolled together on the ground,
and, if one conquered instead of the
other, it was yet a fair fight, and South
Africa has no reason to be ashamed of
the way either her black men or her
white men fought it.</p>

<p class="ind">If it be asked, has the Dutch South
African always dealt gently and generously
with the native folks with
whom he came into contact, we answer,
&#8220;No, he has not&#8221;&mdash;neither has any
other white race of whom we have
record in history. He kept slaves in<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the early days! Yes, and a century ago
England wished to make war on her
American subjects in Virginia for refusing
to take the slaves she sent.
There was a time when we might have
vaunted some superiority in the English-African
method of dealing with the
native.</p>

<p class="center">THAT DAY IS PAST.</p>

<p>The terrible events of the last five years
in South Africa have left us silent.
There is undoubtedly a score laid
against us on this matter, Dutch and
English South Africans alike; for the
moment it is in abeyance; in fifty or a
hundred years it will probably be presented
for payment as other bills are,
and the white man of Africa will have
to settle it. It has been run up as heavily
north of the Limpopo as south; and
when our sons stand up to settle it, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
will be Dutchmen and Englishmen together
who have to pay for the sins of
their fathers.</p>

<p class="ind">Such is the history of our fellow
South Africans of Dutch extraction,
who to-day cover South Africa from
Capetown to the Limpopo. In the Cape
Colony, and increasingly in the two Republics,
are found enormous numbers
of cultured and polished Dutch-descended
South Africans, using English
as their daily form of speech, and
in no way distinguishable from the rest
of the nineteenth century Europeans.
Our most noted judges, our most eloquent
lawyers, our most skillful physicians,
are frequently men of this blood;
the lists of the yearly examinations of
our Cape University are largely filled
with Dutch names, and women, as well
as men, rank high in the order of merit.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
It would sometimes almost seem as if
the long repose the people has had from
the heated life of cities, with the large
tax upon the nervous system, had sent
them back to the world of intellectual
occupations with more than the ordinary
grasp of power. In many cases
they go home to Europe to study, and
doubtless their college life and English
friendships bind Britain close to their
hearts as to ours who are English-born.
The present State Attorney of the
Transvaal is a man who has taken
some of the highest honors Cambridge
can bestow. Besides, there exist still
our old simple farmers or Boers, found
in the greatest perfection in the midland
districts of the Colony, in the
Transvaal and Free State, who constitute
a large part of the virile backbone
of South Africa. Clinging to their old<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
seventeenth century faiths and manners,
and speaking their African taal,
they are yet tending to pass rapidly
away, displaced by their own cultured
modern children; but they still form a
large and powerful body. Year by
year the lines dividing the South Africans
from their more lately arrived
English-descent brothers are</p>

<p class="center">PASSING AWAY.</p>

<p>Love, not figuratively but literally, is
obliterating the line of distinction;
month by month, week by week, one
might say hour by hour, men and women
of the two races are meeting. In the
Colony there are few families which
have not their Dutch or English connections
by marriage; in another generation
the fusion will be complete.
There will be no Dutchmen then and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
no Englishmen in South Africa, but
only the great blended South African
people of the future, speaking the English
tongue, and holding in reverend
memory its founders of the past,
whether Dutch or English. Already,
but for the sorrowful mistakes of the
last years, the line of demarcation
would have faded out of sight; external
impediments may tend to delay it, but
they can never prevent this fusion; we
are one people. In thirty years&#8217; time,
the daughter of the man who landed
yesterday in South Africa will carry
at her heart the child of a de Villiers,
and the son of the Cornish miner who
lands this week will have given the
name of her English grandmother to
his daughter, whose mother was a le
Roux. There will be nothing in forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
years but the great blended race of
Africans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ind">These South Africans, together with
those of English descent, but who have
been more than two generations in the
country and have had no&mdash;or very little&mdash;personal
and intimate knowledge and
intercourse with England, may be
taken as standing on one side of us.
They are before all things South Africans.
They have&mdash;both Dutch and
English&mdash;in many cases a deep and sincere
affection for the English language,
English institutions, and a sincere affection
for England herself. They are
grateful to her for her watch over their
seas; and were a Russian fleet to appear
in Table Bay to-morrow and attempt
to land troops, it would fly as
quickly from Dutch as English bullets.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Neither Dutch nor English South Africans
desire to see any other power installed
in the place of England. Cultured
Dutch and English Africans alike
are fed on English literature, and England
is their intellectual home. Even
with our simplest Dutch-descent Africans
the memories of</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD BITTER DAYS</p>

<p>had almost faded, when the ghastly
events, which are too well known to
need referring to, awoke the old ache
at the heart a few years ago. But even
they would see quietly no other power
standing in the place of England. &#8220;It
is a strange thing,&#8221; said a well-known
Dutch South African to us twenty-one
years ago, &#8220;that when I went to Europe
to study I went to Holland, and
loved the land and the people, but I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a stranger; it was the same in Germany,
the same in France. But when
I landed in England I said, &#8216;I am at
home!&#8217;&#8221; That man was once a passionate
lover of England, but he is now
a heart-sore man. There have been
representatives of England in South
Africa who have been loved as dearly
by the Dutch as by the English. When
a few years ago there was a talk of Sir
George Grey visiting South Africa on
his way home from New Zealand to
England, old grey-headed Dutchmen
in the Free State expressed their resolve
to take one more long train journey
and go down to Capetown only
once more to shake the hand of the old
man who more than forty years before
had been Governor of the Cape Colony.
So deeply had a great Englishman, upholding
the loftiest traditions of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
justice and humanity, endeared
himself to the hearts of South Africans.
&#8220;God&#8217;s Englishman&#8221;&mdash;not of the Stock
Exchange and the Gatling gun, but of
the great heart.</p>

<p class="ind">But great as is the bond between
South Africans, whether Dutch or
English, and England, caused by language,
sentiments, interest and the
noble record left by those large Englishmen
who have labored among us,
the South African pure and simple,
whether English or Dutch, cannot feel
to England just as we do. Their material
interest may bind them to England
as much as it binds us, but that
deep passion for her honor, the consciousness
that she represents a large
spiritual factor in our lives, which, once
gone, nothing replaces for us; that her
right-doing is ours, and her wrong-doing<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
is also ours; that in a manner her
flag does not represent anything we
have an interest in, or even that we
love, but that in a curious way it is
ourselves&mdash;this they cannot know.
Therefore, while on our side we are
connected with them by our affection
for South Africa and our resolute desire
for its good, our position remains
not exactly as theirs. Our standpoint
is at once broader and more impartial
in dealing with South African questions,
in that we are bound by two-fold
sympathies.</p>

<p class="ind">On the other hand of us, who are at
once South Africans and Englishmen,
stand in South Africa another body of
individuals who are not South African,
in any sense or only partially, but to
whom from our peculiar position we
also stand closely bound.</p>



<p class="ind"><span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Ever since the time when England
took over the Cape, there has been
slowly entering the country a thin
stream of new settlers, English mainly,
but largely reinforced by people of
other nationalities. Eighty years ago,
in 1820, a comparatively large body of
Englishmen arrived at once, and are
known as the British Settlers. They
settled at first mainly in Albany, and
certain of their descendants are to-day,
in some senses, almost as truly and
typically South African as the older
Dutch settlers.</p>

<p class="center">THEIR LOVE FOR AFRICA</p>

<p>is intense. Some years later a large
body of Germans were brought to the
Kingwilliams town division of South
Africa. They, too, became farmers,
and their descendants are already true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
South Africans. For the rest, for
years men continually dribbled in slowly
and singly from other countries.
Whether they came out in search of
health, as clergymen, missionaries, or
doctors, or in search of manual employment,
or as farmers, they almost all became,
or tended to become almost immediately,
South Africans. They settled
in the land permanently among
people who were permanent inhabitants,
they often married women born in
South Africa, and their roots soon sank
deeply into it. They brought us no
new problem to South Africa. They
have settled among us, living as we
live, sharing our lives and interests. It
is said that it takes thirty years to make
a South African, and in a manner this
is true. Even now, more especially in
times of stress or danger, it is easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
distinguish the African-born man from
the man of whatever race and however
long in the country who has not been
born here. But in the main these newcomers
have become South Africans
with quickness and to an astonishing
degree, and coming in in driblets they
were, so to speak, easily digested by
South Africa.</p>

<p class="ind">But during the last few years</p>

<p class="center">A NEW PHENOMENON HAS STARTED</p>

<p>up in South African life. The discovery
of vast stores of mineral wealth in
South Africa, more especially gold, has
attracted suddenly to its shores a large
population which is not and cannot, at
least at once, be South African. This
body is known under the name of the
Uitlanders (literally &#8220;Foreigners&#8221;).</p>

<p class="ind">Through a misfortune, and by no<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
fault of its own, the mass of this gold
has been discovered mainly along the
Witwatersrand, within the territory of
the Transvaal Republic, and more especially
at the spot where the great mining
camp of Johannesburg now stands,
thus throwing upon the little Republic
the main pressure of the new arrivals.</p>

<p class="ind">To those who know the great mining
camps of Klondike and Western America,
it is perhaps not necessary to describe
Johannesburg. Here are found
that diverse and many-shaded body of
humans, who appear wherever in the
world gold is discovered. The Chinaman
with his pigtail, the Indian Coolie,
the manly Kafir, and the Half-caste; all
forms of dark and colored folk are
here, and outnumber considerably the
white. Nor is the white population less
multifarious and complex. On first<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
walking the streets, one has a strange
sense of having left South Africa, and
being merely in some cosmopolitan center,
which might be anywhere where all
nations and colors gather round the yellow
king. Russian Jews and Poles are
here by thousands, seeking in South
Africa the freedom from oppression
that was denied that much-wronged
race of men in their own birth-land;
Cornish and Northumberland miners;
working men from all parts of the
earth; French, German and English
tradesmen; while on the Stock Exchange
men of every European nationality
are found, though the Jew predominates.
The American strangers
are not large in number, but are represented
by perhaps the most cultured and
enlightened class in the camp, the mining
engineer and large importers of<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mining machinery being often of that
race; our lawyers and doctors are of all
nationalities, while in addition to all
foreigners, there is a certain admixture
of English and Dutch South Africans.
In the course of a day one is brought
into contact with men of every species.
Your household servant may be a Kafir,
your washerwoman is a Half-caste,
your butcher is a Hungarian, your baker
English, the man who soles your
boots a German, you buy your vegetables
and fruit from an Indian Coolie,
your coals from the Chinaman round
the corner, your grocer is a Russian
Jew, your dearest friend an American.
This is an actual, and not an imaginary,
description. Here are found the most
noted prostitutes of Chicago; and that
sad sisterhood created by the dislocation
of our yet uncoordinated civilization,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and known in Johannesburg under
the name of continental women,
have thronged here in hundreds from
Paris and the rest of Europe. Gambling,
as in all mining camps, is rife;
not merely men but even women put
their money into the totalisator, and</p>

<p class="center">A LOW FEVER OF ANXIETY</p>

<p>for chance wealth feeds on us. Crimes
of violence are not unknown; but, if
one may speak with authority who has
known only one other great mining
center in its early condition, and whose
information on this matter has therefore
been gathered largely from books,
Johannesburg compares favorably, and
<i>very</i> favorably, with other large mining
camps in the same stage of their
existence. The life of culture and impersonal
thought is largely and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
necessity among a new and nomadic
population absent; art and science are
of necessity unrepresented; but a general
alertness and keenness characterizes
our population. In the bulk of our
miners and working men, of our young
men in banks and houses of business,
we have a large mass of solid, intelligent,
and invaluable social material
which counter-balances that large mass
of human flotsam and jetsam found in
this, as in all other mining camps; while
among our professional men and mining
officials is found a large amount of
the highest professional knowledge and
efficiency. Happy would it be for the
gallant little Transvaal Republic, and
well for South Africa as a whole, if
the bulk of this little human nature
could become ours forever, if they were
here to stay with us, drink out of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cup and sup out of our platter. But in
most cases this is not so. The bulk of
the population, and especially its most
valuable and cultured elements, are
here temporarily; as persons who go to
Italy or the south of France for health
or sunshine, who, even when they go
year after year, or buy villas and settle
there for a time, yet go to seek merely
health and sunshine, not strike root
there; and as men go to Italy for
health and sunshine, the bulk of us here
come to seek gold or a temporary livelihood,
and for nothing more. Even our
miners and working men in Johannesburg,
the most stable and possibly permanent
element in our population, have,
in many instances, their wives and families
in Cornwall or elsewhere; and
when they have them here they still
think of the return home for good in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after years; while with the wealthier
classes this is practically universal. Not
only have our leading mining engineers
and the great speculators not the slightest
intention of staying in Johannesburg
permanently; most have their
wives and families in England, America,
or on the Continent, and project as
soon as possible a retirement from business,
and return to the fashionable circles
of Europe or America. Even
among South African-born men the
large majority of us intend returning
to our own more lovely birthplaces and
homes in the Colony sooner or later;
and the only element which will probably
form any integral part of the
South African nation of the future and
become subject to the Transvaal Republic
is the poorer, which, from the
larger advantages for labor here, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
be unable to return to its natural home.</p>

<p class="ind">The nomadic population of Johannesburg
undoubtedly consists of men who
are brave and loyal citizens in their
own States and nations. To-morrow,</p>

<p class="center">IF AMERICA WERE IN DANGER,</p>

<p>probably almost every American citizen
would troop back to her bosom, and
spend not only life, but the wealth he
had gained in South Africa from South
African soil, in defending her. Every
German would go home to the Fatherland;
every Englishman, every Frenchman,
would, as all brave men in the
world&#8217;s history have done, when the cry
arises, &#8220;The birth-land in danger!&#8221; The
few Spaniards here trooped back to
Spain as soon as the news of war arrived.</p>

<p class="ind">One of the most brilliant and able of<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
English journalists (a man whose opinion
on any subject touching his own
land we would receive almost with the
reverence accruing to the man who
speaks of a subject he knows well and
has studied with superior abilities; but
who had been only a few months in our
land, and, therefore, had not full grasp
of either our people or our problems,
which from their complexity and many-sidedness
are subjects for a life&#8217;s devotion)
that man, three and a half years
ago, when brave little Jameson&mdash;brave,
however mistaken&mdash;was sent in to capture
the mines of Johannesburg for his
master, and when the great mixed population
of Johannesburg, Germans and
French, English and Jews, Arabs and
Chinamen, refused to arise and go to
aid him, and when hundreds of Englishmen,
Cornishmen and others fled<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from Johannesburg, fearing that Jameson
might arrive and cause a disturbance&mdash;said
that Johannesburg
would be known forever in history by
the name of <i>Judasburg!</i> and that the
Cornish and other Englishmen who fled
from the place were poltroons and
cowards. But he was mistaken.</p>

<p class="center">JOHANNESBURG IS NOT JUDASBURG,</p>

<p>and the Englishmen who fled were not
poltroons. There ran in them blood as
brave as any in England, and if to-morrow
a hostile force attacked their birth-land,
those very Cornish miners and
English working men would die in the
last ditch defending their land. Those
men were strangers here; they came to
earn the bread they could with difficulty
win in their own land; they were
friendly treated by South Africa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
made money here; but were they bound
to die in a foreign land for causes which
they neither knew nor cared for?</p>

<p class="ind">One thing only can possibly justify
war and the destruction of our fellows
to the enlightened and humane denizen
of the nineteenth century; the unavoidable
conviction that by no other means
can we preserve our own life and freedom
from a stronger power, or defend
a weaker state or individual from a
stronger. Nothing can even palliate it
but so intense a conviction of a right so
great to be maintained that we are willing,
not merely to hire other men to
fight and die for us, but to risk our own
lives,</p>

<p class="center">A LIFE FOR A LIFE.</p>

<p class="ind">This the Englishmen in Johannesburg
and foreigners of all nations could
not possibly feel. They were not more<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bound to die to obtain control of the
gold mines of Johannesburg for a man
already wealthy or his confederates,
than to assist South Africans in defending
them; or than we who visit the
south of France or Italy for health
should feel ourselves bound to remain
and die if war breaks out between the
Bonapartists and the Republicans, or
the Pope and the King. If by a process
of abstract thought we have arrived
at a strong conviction of a right
or human justice to be maintained by
a cause with which we have no practical
concern, we may feel morally
compelled to take a part in it; but no
man can throw it in our teeth if we
refuse to die in a strange land for</p>

<p class="center">A CAUSE THAT IS NOT OURS.</p>

<p class="ind">The Englishmen and others who refused<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to fight in Johannesburg, or fled
rather than run the risk of remaining,
pursued the only course open to wise
and honorable men. Had they resolved
to remain permanently in South Africa,
and to become citizens of the Transvaal
Republic, the case might have been
otherwise. As it was, they could not
run a knife into the heart of a people
which had hospitably received them,
and attempt to destroy a land in which
they had found nothing but greater
wealth and material comfort than in
their own; and they could also not enter
upon a deadly raid for a man whom
personally the workers of Johannesburg
cared nothing for, and with whom
they had not a sympathy or interest in
common. In leaving Johannesburg and
refusing to fight, they pursued the only<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
course left open to them by justice and
honor.</p>

<p class="ind">Rightly to understand the problem
before the little Transvaal Republic to-day,
it is necessary for Englishmen to
imagine not merely that, within the
space of ten or twelve years, forty millions
of Russians, Frenchmen and Germans
should enter England, not in
driblets and in time extending over half
a century, so that they might, in a
measure, be absorbed and digested into
the original population, but instantaneously
and at once; not merely, that the
large bulk of them did not intend to remain
in England, and were there merely
to extract wealth; not merely, that
the bulk of this wealth was exported at
once to other countries enriching Russia,
France and Germany out of the
products of English soil; that would be<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
comparatively a small matter&mdash;but, that
the bulk of the wealth extracted was in
the hands of a few persons, and that
these persons were opposed to the continued
freedom and independence of
England, and were attempting by the
use of the wealth they extracted from
England to stir up Russia and France
against her, that through the loss of
her freedom they might the better obtain
the command of her wealth and
lands. When the Englishman has
vividly drawn this future for himself,
he will hold, as nearly as is possible, in
a nutshell an image of the problem
which the people and government of
the Transvaal Republic are called on
to face to-day; and we put it straightly
to him whether this problem is not
one of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">INFINITE COMPLEXITY AND
DIFFICULTY?</p>

<p class="ind">Much unfortunate misunderstanding
has arisen from the simple use of the
terms &#8220;capitalist&#8221; and &#8220;monopolist&#8221; in
the discussion of South African matters.
Without the appending of explanation,
they convey a false impression.
These terms, so familiar to the
students of social phenomena in Europe
and America, are generally used
in connection with a larger, but a quite
distinct body of problems. The terms
&#8220;capitalism,&#8221; &#8220;monopolist,&#8221; and &#8220;millionaire&#8221;
are now generally associated
with the question of the forming of
&#8220;trusts,&#8221; &#8220;corners,&#8221; etc., and the
question whether it is desirable that society
should so organize itself that one
man may easily obtain possession of
twenty millions, while the bulk of<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
equally intelligent and equally laborious
men obtain little or nothing from the
labor of humanity. This question is a
world-wide question; it is not one in
any sense peculiarly South African; it
is a world-wide problem, which, as the
result of much thought, careful consideration
and many experiments, the nations
of the civilized world will be
called to adjudicate upon during the
twentieth century; but it is not the
question with which South Africa
stands face to face at this moment. The
question before us is not: Shall one
South African possess twenty millions,
live in his palace, live on champagne,
have his yacht in Table Bay, and deck
women with a hundred thousand
pounds&#8217; worth of jewels, while the
South African next door has nothing?
This is not our question. Our problem<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is not the problem of America. In
America there are many individuals
possessing wealth amounting to many
millions, but when the United States in
their entirety is taken the 40,000,000
of the richest individual sink to nothing;
and, were it the desire of the richest
millionaire in the States</p>

<p class="center">TO CORRUPT AND PURCHASE</p>

<p>the whole population for political purposes,
he could not pay so much as 1 a
head to the 80,000,000 inhabitants of
the country. Further, the bulk of
American millionaires are American!
They differ in no respect, except in
their possession of large wealth, in interest
or affections, from the shoemaker
in the alley or the farmer at his
plough. They are American citizens;
their fate is bound up with that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
land they live in; their ambitions are
American. If a great misfortune should
overtake America to-morrow there is
no reason to suppose that the heart of
a Rockefeller or a Vanderbilt would
not ache as that of the simplest cowboy
in the States. When they die, it is to
American institutions that they leave
their munificent donations, and the colleges
and public institutions of America
are endowed by them. The mass even
of that wealth they expend on themselves
is expended in America, and,
whether they will or no, returns to the
people of the country in many forms.
The millionaires of America are and remain
Americans; and the J. Gould who
should expend his millions in stirring
up war between the North and South,
or in urging England to attack and slay
American citizens, would be dealt with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
by his fellow-subjects, whether millionaires
or paupers, with expedition.
The question whether the conditions
which lead to such vast accretions of
fortune in the hands of private individuals
is a desirable one and of social
benefit is an open one, and a fair field
for impartial discussion; but, whatever
decision is arrived at with regard to
millionaires and private monopoly as
they exist in Europe or the United
States, it has little or no bearing on the
problem of South Africa, which is totally
distinct.</p>

<p class="ind">South Africa is a young country, and
taken as a whole it is an arid, barren
country agriculturally. Our unrivalled
climate, our sublime and rugged natural
scenery,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE JOY AND PRIDE</p>

<p>of the South African heart, is largely
the result of this very aridity and rockiness.
Parts are fruitful, but we have
no vast corn-producing plains, which
for generations may be cultivated almost
without replenishing, as in Russia
and America; we have few facilities
for producing those vast supplies of
flesh which are poured forth from Australia
and New Zealand; already we
import a large portion of the grain and
flesh we consume. We may, with care,
become a great fruit-producing country,
and create some rich and heavy
wines, but, on the whole, agriculturally,
we are, and must remain, as compared
with most other countries, a poor nation.
Nor have we any great inland
lakes, seas, and rivers, or arms of the
sea, to enable us to become a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
maritime or carrying people. One
thing only we have which saves us from
being the poorest country on the earth,
and should make us one of the richest.
We have our vast stores of mineral
wealth, of gold and diamonds, and
probably of other wealth yet unfound.
This is all we have. Nature has given
us nothing else; we are a poor people
but for these. Out of the veins running
through rocks and hills, and the
mud-beds, heavy with jewels, that lie
in our arid plains, must be reared and
created our great national institutions,
our colleges and museums, our art galleries
and universities; by means of
these our system of education must be
extended; and on the material side, out
of these must the great future of South
Africa be built up&mdash;or not at all. The
discovery of our mineral wealth came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
somewhat suddenly upon us. We were
not prepared for its appearance by wise
legislative enactments, as in New Zealand
or some other countries. Before
the people of South Africa as a whole
had had time to wake up to the truth
and to learn the first</p>

<p class="center">GREAT AND TERRIBLE LESSON,</p>

<p>our diamonds should have taught us
the gold mines of the Transvaal were
discovered.</p>

<p class="ind">We South Africans, Dutch and English
alike, are a curious folk, strong,
brave, with a terrible intensity and perseverance,
but we are not a sharp people
well versed in the movements of the
speculative world. In a few years the
entire wealth of South Africa, its mines
of gold and diamonds, its coal fields,
and even its most intractable lands,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from the lovely Hex River Valley to
Magaliesberg, had largely passed into
the hands of a very small knot of speculators.
In hardly any instances are
they South Africans. That they were
not South African-born would in itself
matter less than nothing, had they
thrown in their lot with us, if in sympathies,
hopes, and fears they were one
with us. They are not. It is not merely
that the wealth which should have
made us one of the richest peoples in the
world has left us one of the poorest,
and is exported to other countries, that
it builds palaces in Park Lane, buys
yachts in the Mediterranean, fills the
bags of the croupiers at Monte Carlo,
decks foreign women with jewels, while
our citizens toil in poverty; this is a
small matter. But those men are not
of us! That South Africa we love<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
whose great future is dearer to us than
our own interests, in the thought of
whose great and noble destiny lies the
source of our patriotism and highest inspiration,
for whose good in a far distant
future we, Dutch and English
alike, would sacrifice all in the present&mdash;this
future is no more to them than
the future of the Galapagos Islands.
We are a hunting ground to them, a
field for extracting wealth, for</p>

<p class="center">BUILDING UP FAME AND FORTUNE;</p>

<p>nothing more. This matter does not
touch the Transvaal alone; from the
lovely Hex River Valley, east, west,
north, and south, our lands are being
taken from us, and passing into the
hands of men who not only care nothing
for South Africa, but apply the vast
wealth they have drawn from South African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
soil in an attempt to corrupt our
public life and put their own nominees
into our parliaments, to grasp the reins
of power, that their wealth may yet
more increase. Is it strange that from
the hearts of South Africans, English
and Dutch alike, there is arising an exceedingly
great and bitter cry: &#8220;We
have sold our birthright for a mess of
pottage! The lands, the mineral wealth
which should have been ours to build
up the great Africa of the future has
gone into strange hands! And they
use the gold they gain out of us to enslave
us; they strike at our hearts with
a sword gilded with South African
gold! While the gold and stones remained
undiscovered in the bosom of
our earth, it was saved up for us and
for our grandchildren to build up the
great future; it is going from us never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to return; and when they have rifled
our earth and picked the African bones
bare as the vultures clear the carcass
of their prey, they will leave us with the
broken skeleton!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ind">I think there is no broad-minded and
sympathetic man who can hear this cry
without sympathy. The South African
question is far other than the question:
Shall one man possess twenty millions
while his brother possesses none? It is
one far deeper.</p>

<p class="ind">Nevertheless, there is another side to
the question. Nations, like individuals,
suffer, and must pay the price, yet more
for their ignorance and stupidity than
their wilful crimes. He who sits supine
and intellectually inert, while great evils
are being accomplished, sins wholly as
much as he whose positive action produces
them, and must pay the same<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
price. The man at the helm who goes
to sleep cannot blame the rock when
the ship is thrown upon it, though it be
torn asunder. He should have known
the rock was there, and steered clear of
it. It is perhaps natural</p>

<p class="center">A GREAT BITTERNESS</p>

<p>should have arisen in our hearts towards
the men who have disinherited
us; but is it always just? Personally,
and in private life, they may be far from
being inhuman or unjust; they may be
rich in such qualities; at most they remain
men and brothers who differ in no
way from the majority of us. We
made certain laws and regulations;
they took advantage of them for their
own success; they have but pursued
the universal laws of the business
world, and of the struggle of competition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
It was we who did not defend
ourselves, and must take the consequences.
As long as any of these men
merely use the wealth they extract
from Africa for their own pleasures and
interest, we have not much to complain
of, and must bear the fruit of our folly.
The speculators who rule in Mashonaland
were wiser than we; they ordained
that 50 per cent of all gold mining
profits should go to the government,
and they retained all diamonds found as
a government monopoly. We were not
wise enough to do so, and the nation
must suffer. But poverty is not the
worst thing that can overtake an individual
or a nation. In that harsh
school the noblest lessons and the
sturdiest virtues are learnt. The greatest
nations, like the greatest individuals,
have often been the poorest; and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wealth comes often what is more terrible
than poverty&mdash;corruption. Not all
the millionaires of Europe can prevent
one man of genius being born in this
land to illuminate it; not all the gold
of Africa can keep us from being the
bravest, freest nation on earth; no man
living can shut out from our eyes the
glories of our African sky, or kill one
throb of our exultant joy in our great
African plains; nor can all earth prevent
us from growing into a great, free,
wise people. The faults of the past we
cannot undo; but</p>

<p class="center">THE FUTURE IS OURS.</p>

<p>But when the men, who came penniless
to our shores and have acquired millions
out of our substance, are not content
with their gains; when they seek to dye
the South African soil which has received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
them with the blood of its citizens&mdash;when
they seek her freedom&mdash;the
matter is otherwise.</p>

<p class="ind">This is the problem, the main weight
of which has fallen on the little South
African Republic. It was that little
ship which received the main blow
when eighty thousand souls of all nationalities
leaped aboard at once; and
gallantly the taut little craft, if for a
moment she shivered from stem to
stern, has held on her course to shore,
with all souls on board.</p>

<p class="ind">We put it, not to the man in the
street, who, for lack of time or interest,
may have given no thought to such
matters, but to all statesmen, of whatever
nationality, who have gone deeply
into the problems of social structure
and the practical science of government,
and to all thinkers who have devoted<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
time and study to the elucidation of social
problems and the structure of societies
and nations, whether the problem
placed suddenly for solution before this
little State does not exceed in complexity
and difficulty that which it has almost
ever been a necessity that the people
of any country in the past or present
should deal with? When we remember
how gravely is discussed the arrival
of a few hundred thousand Chinamen
in America, who are soon lost in the
vast bulk of the population, as a handful
of chaff is lost in a bag of corn; when
we recall the fact that the appearance
in England of a few thousand labouring
Polish and Russian Jews amidst a vast
population, into which they will be absorbed
in less than two generations
forming good and leal English subjects,
has been solemnly adverted upon as</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">A GREAT NATIONAL CALAMITY,</p>

<p>and measures have been weightily discussed
for forcibly excluding them, it
will assuredly be clear, to all impartial
and truth loving minds, that the problem
which the Transvaal Republic has
suddenly had to deal with is one of
transcendent complexity and difficulty.
We put it to all generous and just spirits,
whether of statesmen or thinkers,
whether the little Republic does not deserve
our sympathy, the sympathy
which wise minds give to all who have
to deal with new and complex problems,
where the past experience of humanity
has not marked out a path&mdash;and whether,
if we touch the subject at all, it is
not necessary that it should be in that
large, impartial, truth-seeking spirit, in
which humanity demands we should approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all great social difficulties and
questions?</p>

<p class="ind">We put it further to such intelligent
minds as have impartially watched the
action and endeavors of the little Republic
in dealing with its great problems,
whether, when all the many sides
and complex conditions are considered,
it has not manfully and wonderfully endeavored
to solve them?</p>

<p class="ind">It is sometimes said that when one
stands looking down from the edge of
this hill at the great mining camp of
Johannesburg stretching beneath, with
its heaps of white sand and debris
mountains high, its mining chimneys
belching forth smoke, with its seventy
thousand Kafirs, and its eighty thousand
men and women, white or colored,
of all nationalities gathered here in the
space of a few years, on the spot where<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
fifteen years ago the Boer&#8217;s son guided
his sheep to the water and the Boer&#8217;s
wife sat alone at evening at the house
door to watch the sunset, we are looking
upon one of the most wonderful
spectacles on earth. And it is wonderful;
but, as we look at it, the thought
always arises within us of something
more wonderful yet&mdash;the marvelous
manner in which a little nation of simple
folk, living in peace in the land they
loved, far from the rush of cities and
the concourse of men, have risen to the
difficulties of their condition; how they,
without instruction in statecraft, or traditionary
rules of policy, have risen to
face their great difficulties, and have
sincerely endeavored to meet them in a
large spirit, and have largely succeeded.
Nothing but that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CURIOUS AND WONDERFUL INSTINCT</p>

<p>for statecraft and the organization and
arrangement of new social conditions
which seem inherent as a gift of the
blood to all those peoples who took their
rise in the little deltas on the northeast
of the continent of Europe, where the
English and Dutch peoples alike took
their rise, could have made it possible.
We do not say that the Transvaal Republic
has among its guides and rulers
a Solon or a Lycurgus; but it has to-day,
among the men guiding its destiny,
men of brave and earnest spirit, who
are seeking manfully and profoundly to
deal with the great problems before
them in a wide spirit of humanity and
justice. And, we do again repeat, that
the strong sympathy of all earnest and
thoughtful minds, not only in Africa,
but in England, should be with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">Let us take as an example one of the
simplest elements of the question, the
enfranchisement of the new arrivals.
Even those of us, who with the present
writer are sometimes denominated &#8220;the
fanatics of the franchise,&#8221; who hold that
that state is healthiest and strongest,
in the majority of cases, in which every
adult citizen, irrespective of sex or position,
possesses a vote, base our assertion
on the fact that each individual forming
an integral part of the community has
their all at stake in that community;
that the woman&#8217;s stake is likely to be as
large as the man&#8217;s, and the poor man&#8217;s
as the rich; for each has only his all,
his life; and that their devotion to its
future good, and their concern in its
health is likely to be equal; that the
state gains by giving voice to all its integral
parts. But the ground is cut<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
from under our feet when a large mass
of persons concerned are <i>not</i> integral
portions of the State, but merely temporarily
connected with it, have no interest
in its remote future, and only a
commercial interest in its present. We
may hold (and we personally very
strongly hold) that the moment a
stranger lands in a country, however
ignorant he may be of its laws, usages,
and interests, if he intends to remain
permanently in it, and incorporates all
his life and interest with it, he becomes
an integral part of the State, and should
as soon as possible be given the power
of expressing his will through its legislature;
but the</p>

<p class="center">PRACTICAL AND OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY</p>

<p>at once arises of determining who, in
an uncertain stream of strangers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
suddenly flow into a land, <i>is</i> so situated!
I may go to Italy, accompanied by two
friends; we may hire the same house
between us (to use a homely illustration);
there may be no external evidence
of difference in our attitude;
yet I may have determined to live
and die in Italy; I may feel a most
intense affection for its people and
its institutions, and a great solicitude
over its future. The first man who
accompanies me may feel perfectly indifferent
to land and people, and be
there merely for health, leaving again
as soon as it is restored. The second
may be animated by an intense hatred
of Italy and Italians; he not only may
not wish well to the nation, but may desire
to see it downtrodden by Austria,
and its inhabitants destroyed. By enfranchising
me the moment I arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the Italian nation would gain a faithful
and devoted citizen, who would sacrifice
all for her in time of danger, and
devote thought in times of peace; in enfranchising
immediately the second
man, they would perform an act entirely
negative and indifferent without loss
or gain either way; in enfranchising
the third man, they would perform an
act of minor social suicide. Yet it
would be impossible at once, and from
any superficial study to discover our
differences!</p>

<p class="center">THE GREAT SISTER REPUBLIC</p>

<p>across the water has met these difficulties
by instituting a probationary residence
of two years, after which by taking
a solemn oath renouncing all allegiance
to any foreign sovereign or
land, more especially to the ruler of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
England and the English nation, and
declaring their wish to live and die citizens
of the United States, the new
comers are, after a further residence of
another three years, fully enfranchised,
and become citizens of the American
Republic. In this, as in many other
cases, it would appear that the great
Republic has struck on a wise and practical
solution to a complex problem; and
in this matter, as in many others, we,
personally, should like to see the action
of the great sister Republic followed.
But thoughtful minds may suggest, on
the other hand, that, while in America,
at least at the present day, the newly
enfranchised burgher receives but one-sixteen
millionth of the State power and
of governmental control on his enfranchisement,
in a small state like the
Transvaal each new burgher receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
over eight hundred times that power in
the government and control of the
country, and that this makes a serious
difference in the importance of making
sure of the loyalty and sincerity of your
citizen before you enfranchise him. We
see this, and there is something to be
said for it. It has been held by many
sincerely desirous of arriving at a just
and balanced conclusion, that, in a Republic
situated as the Transvaal is, a
longer residence and the votes of a certain
proportion of the already enfranchised
citizens are necessary before the
vast rights conferred by citizenship in
a small purely democratic State are
granted. The terms for the enfranchisement
for foreigners in England yield us
no instructive analogy; for, in a country
with an hereditary sovereign and an
hereditary Upper House the enfranchised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
foreigner receives only a minute
fraction of the power conferred on the
elector in a pure democracy. The little
Russian Jew who has a vote given him
in London can never become the supreme
head of the State, can never sit
in or vote for members of the Upper
House, and receives only the minute

<p class="center">IN A PURE DEMOCRACY</p>

<p>where the people are the sovereign and
represent in themselves the hereditary

Even on this comparatively small question

leal and true. Whoever enters
South Africa and desires to become one
of us, to drink from our cup and sup
from our platter, to mix his seed with
ours and build up the South Africa of
the future&mdash;him let us receive with open
arms. From great mixtures of races
spring great peoples. The scorned and
oppressed Russian Jew, landing here to-day,
vivified by our fresh South African
breezes, may yet be the progenitor
of the Spinoza and Maimonides of the
great future South Africa, who shall
lead the world in philosophy and
thought. The pale German cobbler who
with his wife and children lands to-day,
so he stays with us and becomes
one with us, may yet be the father of
the greater Hans Sachs of Africa; and
the half-starved Irish peasant become
the forerunner of our future Burkes<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and William Porters. The rough Cornish
miner, who is looking out with
surprised eyes at our new South African
world to-day, may yet give to us
our greatest statesmen and noblest leader.
The great African nation of the
future will have its foundations laid on
stones from many lands. Even to the
Coolie and the Chinaman, so he comes
among us, we personally should say:
Stretch forth the hand of brotherhood.
We may not desire him, we may not intentionally
bring him among us, but,
so he comes to remain with us, let South
Africa be home to him.</p>

<p class="ind">We fall to considering, who gains by
war?</p>

<p class="ind">Has our race in Africa and our race
in England interests so diverse that any

that could make necessary that mother
and daughter must rise up in one horrible
embrace, and rend, if it be possible,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
each other&#8217;s vitals?... Believing
it impossible, we fall to considering,
who is it gains by war?</p>

<p class="ind">There is peace to-day in the land; the
two great white races, day by day, hour
by hour, are blending their blood, and
both are mixing with the stranger. No
day passes but from the veins of some
Dutch South African woman the English
South African man&#8217;s child is being
fed; not a week passes but the birth cry
of the English South African woman&#8217;s
child gives voice to the Dutchman&#8217;s offspring;
not an hour passes but on farm,

<p>If the Angel of Death should spread his
wings across the land and strike dead
in one night every man and woman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
child of either the Dutch or the English
blood, leaving the other alive, the land
would be a land of mourning. There
would be not one household nor the
heart of an African born man or woman
that would not be weary with grief.
We should weep the friends of our
childhood, the companions of our early
life, our grandchildren, our kindred, the
souls who have loved us and whom we
have loved. In destroying the one race
he would have isolated the other. Time,
the great healer of all differences, is
blending us into a great mutual people,
and love is moving faster than time. It
is no growing hatred between Dutch
and English South African born men
and women that calls for war. On the
lips of our babes we salute both races
daily.</p>

<p class="ind">Then we look round through the political<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

that blood can alone wash out
blood?</p>

<p class="ind">And we find none.</p>

<p class="ind">And still we look, asking what great

arisen, so mighty that the human intellect
cannot solve it by means of peace,
that the highest and noblest diplomacy
falls powerless before it, and the wisdom

reach it, save by the mother&#8217;s drawing

<p class="ind">Not we the Africans, whose hearts

<p class="center">WHO GAINS BY WAR?</p>

in Africa; we know it now! There are

gain?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ind">But it may be said, &#8220;What matter
who goads England on, or in whose
cause she undertakes war against Africans;
this at least is certain, she can
win. We have the ships, we have the
men, we have the money.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ind">We answer, &#8220;Yes, might generally
conquers&mdash;for a time at least.&#8221; The
greatest empire upon earth, on which
the sun never sets, with its five hundred
million subjects, may rise up in its full
majesty of power and glory, and crush
thirty thousand farmers. It may not
be a victory, but at least it will be
a slaughter. We ought to win. We
have the ships, we have the men, and<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
we have the money. May there not be
something else we need? The Swiss
had it when they fought with Austria;
the three hundred had it at Thermopylae,
although not a man was saved; it
goes to make a victory. Is it worth
fighting if we have not got it?</p>

<p class="ind">I suppose there is no man who to-day
loves his country who has not perceived
that in the life of the nation, as in the
life of the individual, the hour of external
success may be the hour of irrevocable
failure, and that the hour of
death, whether to nations or individuals,
is often the hour of immortality.
When William the Silent, with his little
band of Dutchmen, rose up to face the
whole Empire of Spain, I think there is
no man who does not recognize that the
hour of their greatest victory was not
when they had conquered Spain, and<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hurled backward the greatest Empire of
the world to meet its slow imperial
death; it was the hour when that little
band stood alone with the waters over
their homes,</p>

<p class="center">FACING DEATH AND DESPAIR,</p>

<p>and stood, facing it. It is that hour
that has made Holland immortal, and
her history the property of all human
hearts.</p>

<p class="ind">It may be said, &#8220;But what has England
to fear in a campaign with a country
like Africa? Can she not send out
a hundred thousand or a hundred and
fifty thousand men and walk over the
land? She can sweep it by mere numbers.&#8221;
We answer yes&mdash;she might do
it. Might generally conquers; not always.
(I have seen a little <i>muur kat</i>
attacked by a mastiff, the first joint of<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
whose leg it did not reach. I have seen
it taken in the dog&#8217;s mouth, so that
hardly any part of it was visible, and
thought the creature was dead. But it
fastened its tiny teeth inside the dog&#8217;s
throat, and the mastiff dropped it, and,
mauled and wounded and covered with
gore and saliva, I saw it creep back into
its hole in the red African earth.) But
might generally conquers, and there is
no doubt that England might send out
sixty or a hundred thousand hired soldiers
to South Africa, and they could
bombard our towns and destroy our villages;
they could shoot down men in
the prime of life, and old men and boys,
till there was hardly a kopje in the
country without its stain of blood, and
the Karoo bushes grew up greener on
the spot where men from the midlands,
who had come to help their fellows, fell,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
never to go home. I suppose it would
be quite possible for the soldiers to
shoot all male South Africans who appeared
in arms against them. It might
not be easy, a great many might fall,
but a great Empire could always import
more to take their places; <i>we</i> could not
import more, because it would be our
husbands and sons and fathers who
were falling, and when they were done
we could not produce more. Then the
war would be over. There would not
be a house in Africa&mdash;where African-born
men and women lived&mdash;without
its mourners, from Sea Point to the
Limpopo; but South Africa would be
pacified&mdash;as Cromwell pacified Ireland
three centuries ago, and she has been
being pacified ever since! As Virginia
was pacified in 1677; its handful of men
and women in defence of their freedom<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were soon silenced by hired soldiers. &#8220;I
care that for the power of England,&#8221;
said &#8220;a notorious and wicked rebel&#8221;
called Sarah Drummond, as she took a
small stick and broke it and lay it on
the ground. A few months later her
husband and all the men with him were
made prisoners, and the war was over.
&#8220;I am glad to see you,&#8221; said Berkely,
the English Governor, &#8220;I have long
wished to meet you; you will be hanged
in half an hour!&#8221; and he was hanged
and twenty-one others with him, and
Virginia was pacified. But a few generations
later in that State of Virginia
was born George Washington, and on
the 19th of April, 1775, was fought the
battle of Lexington&mdash;&#8220;Where once
the embattled farmers stood, and fired
a shot, heard round the world,&#8221;&mdash;and
the greatest crime and the greatest folly<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of England&#8217;s career was completed.
England acknowledges it now. A hundred
or a hundred and fifty thousand
imported soldiers might walk over
South Africa; it would not be an easy
walk; but it could be done. Then from
east and west and north and south
would come men of pure English blood
to stand beside the boys they had played
with at school and the friends they had
loved; and a great despairing cry would
rise from the heart of Africa. But we
are still few. When the war was over
the imported soldiers might leave the
land&mdash;not all; some must be left to keep
the remaining people down. There
would be quiet in the land. South Africa
would rise up silently, and count
her dead, and bury them. She would
know the places where she found them.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
South Africa would be peaceful. There
would be silence, the silence of a long
exhaustion&mdash;but not peace! Have the
dead no voices? In a thousand farm
houses black robed women would hold
memory of the count, and outside under
African stones would lie the African
men to whom South African women
gave birth under our blue sky. There
would be silence, but no peace.</p>

<p class="ind">You say that all the fighting men in
arms might have been shot. Yes, but
what of the women? If there were left
but five thousand pregnant South African-born
women, and all the rest of
their people destroyed, those women
would breed up again a race like to the
first.</p>

<p class="center">OH, LION-HEART OF THE NORTH,</p>

<p>do you not recognize your own lineage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

live if we are not free!</p>

<p class="ind">The grandchildren and great-grandchildren
of the men who lay under the
stones (who will not be English then
nor Dutch, but only Africans), will say,
as they pass those heaps: &#8220;There lie
our fathers, or great-grandfathers who
died in the first great War of Independence,&#8221;
and the descendants of the men
who lay there will be the aristocracy of
Africa. Men will count back to them
and say: My father or my great-grandfather
lay in one of those graves. We
shall know no more of Dutch or English
then, we shall know only one great
African people. And <i>we</i>? We, the
South Africans of to-day, who are still
English, who have been proud to do the
smallest good so it might bring honor
to England, who have vowed our vows<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on the honor of Englishmen, and by the
faith of Englishmen&mdash;what of <i>us</i>?</p>

<p class="ind">What of us? We, too, have had our
vision of Empire. We have seen as
in a dream the Empire of England as a
great banyan tree; silently with the falling
of the dew and the dropping of the
rain it has extended itself; its branches
have drooped down and rooted themselves
in the earth; in it all the fowl of
Heaven have taken refuge, and under
its shade all the beasts of the field have
lain down to rest. Can we change it for
an upas tree, whose leaves distill poison
and which spells death to those who
have lain down in peace under its
shadow?</p>

<p class="ind">You have no right to take our dream
from us; you have no right to kill our
faith! Of all the sins England will sin<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
if she makes war on South Africa, the
greatest will be towards us.</p>

<p class="ind">Of what importance is the honor and
faith we have given her? You say, we
are but few! Yes, we are few; but all
the gold of Witwatersrand would not
buy one throb of that love and devotion
we have given her.</p>

<p class="ind">Do not think that when imported soldiers
walk across South African plains
to take the lives of South African men
and women, that it is only African sand
and African bushes that are cracking
beneath their tread: at each step they
are breaking the fibres, invisible as air,
but strong as steel, which bind the
hearts of South Africans to England.
Once broken they can never be made
whole again; they are living things;
broken, they will be dead. Each bullet
which a soldier sends to the heart of a<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
South African to take his life, wakes up
another who did not know he was an
African. You will not kill us with your
Lee-Metfords: you will make us. There
are men who do not know they love a
Dutchman; but the first three hundred
that fall, they will know it.</p>

<p class="ind">Do not say, &#8220;But you are English,
you have nothing to fear: we have no
war with you!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ind">There are hundreds of us, men and
women, who have loved England; we
would have given our lives for her; but,
rather than strike down one South African
man fighting for freedom, we
would take this right hand and hold it
in the fire, till nothing was left of it but
a charred and blackened bone.</p>

<p class="center">THE FIGURE OF FRANKLIN</p>

<p>when he stood before the Lords of
Council in England, giving evidence,
striving, fighting, to save America for
England. Browbeaten, flouted, jeered
at by the courtiers, his words hurled
back at him as lies, he stood there fighting
for England. England recognizes
now that it was he who tried to save an
Empire for her; and that the men who
flouted and browbeat him, lost it. There
is nothing more pathetic than the way
in which Americans who loved England,
Washington and Franklin, strove
to keep the maiden vessel moored close
to the mother&#8217;s side, bound by the bonds
of love and sympathy, that alone could
bind them. Their hands were beaten
down, bruised and bleeding, wounded
by the very men they came to save, till
they let go the mother ship and drifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
away on their own great imperial course

<p class="ind">We could never wrap that mantle

need to-day to sustain England&#8217;s honor
and her Empire of the future, is a man
who must possess more than the knowledge
and wisdom of the intellect.</p>

<p class="ind">When a woman rules a household
with none but the children of her own
body in it, her task is easy; let her obey
nature and she will not fail. But the
woman who finds herself in a large
strange household, where children and
step-children are blended, and where
all have passed the stage of childhood
and have entered on that stage of
adolescence where coercion can no more<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
avail, but where sympathy and comprehension
are the more needed, that woman
has need of large and rare qualities
springing more from the heart than
from the head. She who can win the
love of her strange household in its
adolescence will keep its loyalty and
sympathy when adult years are reached
and will be rich indeed.</p>

<p class="ind">There have been Englishmen in Africa
who had those qualities. Will</p>

<p class="center">THIS NEW ENGLISHMAN OF OURS</p>

<p>evince them and save an Empire for
England and heal South Africa&#8217;s
wounds? Are we asking too much
when we turn our eyes with hope to
him?</p>

<p class="ind">Further off also, across the sea we
look with hope. The last of the race of
great statesmen was not put into the<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
ground with the old man of Hawarden;
the great breed of Chatham and
Burke is not extinct; the hour must
surely bring forth the man.</p>

<p class="ind">We look further yet with confidence,
from the individual to the great heart
of England, the people. The great
fierce freedom-loving heart of England
is not dead yet. Under a thin veneer
of gold we still hear it beat. Behind the
shrivelled and puny English Hyde who
cries only &#8220;gold,&#8221; rises the great English
Jekyll, who cries louder yet &#8220;Justice
and honor.&#8221; We appeal to him;
history shall not repeat itself.</p>

<p class="ind">Nearer home, we turn to one whom
all South Africans are proud of, and
we would say to Paul Kruger, &#8220;Great
old man, first but not last of South
Africa&#8217;s great line of rulers, you have
shown us you could fight for freedom;<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
show us you can win peace. On the
foot of that great statue which in the
future the men and women of South
Africa will raise to you let this stand
written: &#8216;This man loved freedom,
and fought for it; but his heart was
large; he could forget injuries and deal
generously.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="ind">And to our fellow Dutch South Africans,
whom we have learnt to love so
much during the time of stress and
danger, we would say: &#8220;Brothers, you
have shown the world that you know
how to fight; show it you know how to
govern; forget the past; in that Great
Book which you have taken for your
guide in life, turn to Leviticus, and
read there in the 19th chapter, 34th
verse: &#8216;But the stranger that dwelleth
with you shall be unto you as one born
among you, and thou shalt love him as<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thyself; for ye were strangers in the
land of Egypt. I am the Lord your
God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="ind">Be strong, be fearless, be patient.</p>

<p class="ind">We would say to you in the words
of the wise dead President of the Free
State which have become the symbol
of South Africa, &#8220;<i>Wacht een beetje,
alles zal recht kom.</i>&#8221; (Wait a little,
all will come right.)</p>

<p class="ind">On our great African flag let us emblazon
these words, never to take them
down, &#8220;FREEDOM, JUSTICE,
LOVE&#8221;; great are the two first, but
without the last they are not complete.</p>

Vickers has availed himself largely of material
derived from native sources, and he deserves
the thanks of English-reading students for having
compressed so much substance into a single

<p>Mr. Vickers has rendered a great service to
Bohemia in this work, and has evidently spared
no pains to make it valuable.&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p>As a contribution to general historical literature,
Mr. Vickers&#8217; volume is an important event.&mdash;<i>Chicago

<p>Robert H. Vickers has rendered a lasting service

<p>The highest authority on Peruvian history.&mdash;<i>The
Critic.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Markham has done his work well, and
with ardent love for his subject. The country is
a favorite one with him, and has furnished
him with matter for three monographs before
the present history. In a necessarily limited
space he has given the leading facts, and taken
a comprehensive view from the earliest time,
down almost to the current year. Not the least
interesting portions are the brief but strongly
individual sketches of some of the remarkable
men who have figured in the annals of Peru. In
a few virile paragraphs he presents the more
famous generals, viceroys, presidents and patriots.
The book is well equipped with maps,
abounds with pictures, and has an appendix
rich in its statistics and important documents.&mdash;<i>The
Literary World.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Markham is thoroughly at home with his
subject. He possesses a strong, graphic style
eminently suited to it, and the amount of information

<p>It has been Mr. Hancock&#8217;s endeavour to give
a &#8220;complete short history and picture of Chile
in a single volume.&#8221; We may congratulate him
on having achieved his design. Mr. Hancock&#8217;s
virtues are those of painstaking chronicler.
And he has those virtues in full quantity. Not
that the author is without dramatic power. The
concluding chapters of this valuable book on the
ethnology, geology, agriculture, communications,
and resources of Chile are of great interest.&mdash;<i>London
Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>Within the compass of less than 500 octavo
pages the author gives a succinct and rapid narrative
of the history of Chile, its institutions,
the character of its people, and its present conditions,
resources and outlook. He has made a
painstaking examination of authorities, and has
preserved a due sense of proportion.&mdash;<i>Boston
Journal.</i></p>

<p>It is on the period between the years 1830 and
1880, however, that the interest of the reader
will concentrate itself, and recognizing this fact
Mr. Hancock has spared no pains in rendering
this part of the work the most brilliant and authentic.
It is in every respect a thoroughly readable
and accurate work, dealing with the history
of a country which promises to be of much
greater importance among the nations of the
earth.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Item.</i></p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
